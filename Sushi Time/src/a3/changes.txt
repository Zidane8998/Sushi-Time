//implement GameWorldProxy correctly in Game/both views
//fix GameCollection error with shark moving out of area deletion (IndexOutofBounds)
//fix movement within panel (limit to current size?) (make default size bigger)
//fix turn-around for fish
//fix game ending if no fish
//fix net should scoop food
//add/subtract random neg/pos values to fish/shark movement
//hard-code beginning number of fish
//fix random add/subtraction of movement
//add pause and reverse to menubar
//pause should prevent all commands except Reverse (pass arraylist of all registered commands)
//fix sound toggle from being greyed out by pause
//add dialog box at end of game showing score
//update "About"
//fix scoop making sound when game sound off
have views iterate through collection, not pass directly from gameworld

//------------Graphics Implementation-------------------//
//MapView must implement paintComponent() (extend graphics?)
//update() in MapView must iterate through collection and have each object draw/redraw themselves
//GameObjects must implement an IDrawable interface with method draw(Graphics g) to replace toString() method
//Game must include timer to drive animation (20msec tick)
//Game timer must call actionPerformed() for each clock tick, call "Tick" command and replacing "Tick Clock" button
Game timer should pass an "elapsed time" value to move() method in Tick so objects move consistantly
//draw sushibar

//------------Collision Detection----------------------//
//add collision of net with sushibar, have it update points
//add sounds polymorphically
//prevent fish/sharks/seaweed from spawning on sushibar
